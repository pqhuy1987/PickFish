FREESOUND.ZIP - A sound collection for game development

The sounds in this archive have been downloaded from the WEB site
'freesound.org'. They are distributed under the Creative Commons
Sampling Plus 1.0 license. The license can be found here:

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/

Excerpt from the license:

'Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of the original
Work, or if You choose to use the original Work as a whole, You must
either use the Work as an insubstantial portion of Your Derivative Work(s)
or transform it into something substantially different from the original
Work.'

My interpretation is that if you only include a couple of sounds in
unchanged form into a several MB game level or into a large game pack,
then you are in the clear. I also believe that according to the terms of
the license modified sounds (derivative works) may be distributed under
the GNU General Public License. Disclaimer: IANAL, so ask one if this is
important to you.

Sounds on 'freesound.org' are in many different formats (WAV, AIF,
MP3, OGG, FLAC, etc.). In addition, their sample size and  number
of channels are also variable (8, 16 or 24 bits, mono or stereo).
Quake III Arena and its derivatives use 16-bit mono sounds sampled at
22 kHz. In order to make the sounds in this archive easier to use, I
have converted them to this format. I have also removed silent and/or
uninteresting parts from the original sound samples, and made them
seamlessly looping when it was possible. Not all sounds have been
modified by me (maybe 90 percent, I am not sure), so you should
look up the original and make a comparison if you are worried abut
license issues.

Sounds in the archive are divided into several categories, each having
a separate folder. The following categories are used at present:

alarm
ambience
animal
bell_gong
bubbling
choir
click
creaking
drip
electric
fire
footstep
grunt_fight
hissing_noise
hum
human
machine
mechanical
metallic
monster
musical
rain
ringing
scream
shot_explosion
splash
swoosh
thunder
water
weird_scifi
wind

This categorization is probably not perfect, but certainly better than
having all files in a single folder. The archive at present contains about
740 sound samples.

I have kept the original sound names (ecept for occasional '_1', '_2',
etc. postfixes when several sounds were derived from a single downloaded
sample). The names are quite haphazard but the arrangement of the
different parts is consistent:

1. each name starts wiht a unique ID number
2. the next token is the name/ID of the author
3. the rest is a brief description

So when you want to give credit (as you are obliged to do), you should
quote the ID number and the following token (author name) and mention
'freesound.org'.

In case if you are curious why I created this archive: I am one of the
developers of the freely distributable minimalistic clone of Q3A called
Q3MIN (http://www.q3min.org). We needed this material for the creation
of replacements for the sounds used in the original game. I thought that
other people working on maps or mods may also find this stuff useful, so
just zipped the folder where I kept these sounds and added this README.

Enjoy!
